# Two types of Export/Import

- Default Export/Import
    export default Component;
    import Component from "path";

- Named Export/Import
    export const Component;
    import {Component} from "path";

# react hook 
- normal js fn where that function is a utility fn(has some logic inside)

- useState() - generate superpowerful state variables in react
- super powerful variable keeps UI in sync with data layer
- As soon as my state variable changes, it automatically refreshes the component(this concept known as rerender)
- whenever state variable changes react rerenders the component (react will quickly update the UI)

- useEffect()
